# MULTICR
This is the replication package of our paper entitled: "MULTICR: Predicting Merged and Abandoned Code Changes in Modern Code Review Using Multi-Objective Genetic Programming"

We provide the necessary data to replicate the results of our study: <br />
1- [Python scripts](https://github.com/stilab-ets/multicr/tree/main/result%20analysis%20scripts) to replicate the results of the work of [Islam et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584921002032) <br />
2- The studied [datasets](https://github.com/stilab-ets/multicr/tree/main/Datasets). <br />
3- The used [R scripts](https://github.com/stilab-ets/multicr/blob/main/result%20analysis%20scripts/scott_knott.R) for the statistical analysis. <br />
4- The obtained [results](https://github.com/stilab-ets/multicr/tree/main/result%20analysis%20scripts) with the utility scripts. <br />
5- The implementation of [MULTICR](https://github.com/stilab-ets/multicr/tree/main/MULTICR_implementation)
